Report:

Steps I followed
ran npm init
configured node
npm init @eslint/config
configured es lint
opened .eslintrc.{js,yml,json}
added rules to use double quotes and include semi colons
made a test js file, worte a string that would trigger the lack of double qoutes
ran the linter and confirmed it worked

Issues I encountered
I didn't understand the way rules worked and originally had it set to only like single quotes which is gross

Observations
es lint is useful because it makes code conform, and it could be really useful if your company has an overall style guide
